# Testimonial Grid

## Project Overview
The **Testimonial Grid** is a responsive web page that showcases testimonials from various individuals. The design is built with HTML and CSS and is focused on presenting the testimonials in a clean, grid-based layout. Each testimonial includes the individual's portrait, name, status, an introductory text, and a detailed quote. 

This project uses basic HTML5, CSS3, and custom grid layouts to achieve a visually appealing and functional design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Layout**: The testimonials are arranged in a grid layout that adjusts based on the screen size (uses CSS Grid).
- **Customizable Styling**: The project is styled using CSS, with custom fonts, colors, and spacing.

## Technologies Used
